## Overview

This document provides the detailed epic breakdown for the Sustainable Model Village Management System, expanding on the high-level epic list in the [PRD](./PRD.md).

Each epic includes:

- Story sequencing and dependencies

**Epic Sequencing Principles:**

- Epic 1 establishes foundational infrastructure and initial functionality
- Subsequent epics build progressively, each delivering significant end-to-end value
- Stories within epics are vertically sliced and sequentially ordered
- No forward dependencies - each story builds only on previous work
