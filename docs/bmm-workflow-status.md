## Architecture Decisions Completed

**Technology Stack:**
- Frontend: Quasar Framework v2.18.5 (Vue 3 + Vite + SSR)
- Backend: Appwrite v21.2.1 (Auth, Database, Storage, Functions)
- State Management: Pinia
- Offline Sync: IndexedDB + Dexie.js
- Date/Time: date-fns
- Charts: Chart.js v4.5.1
- Calendar: vue-cal v5
- Code Quality: ESLint + Prettier

**Key Architectural Patterns:**
- Normalized database schema (ID-based relationships)
- Composable error handling (useErrorHandler)
- Custom form validation (integrated with error handler)
- Appwrite Storage with automatic chunking
- Vue 3 `<script setup>` syntax (mandatory)
- Offline-first with 2-day buffer and sync queue

**Documentation:**
- Complete architecture document: `docs/architecture.md`
- All critical decisions documented with rationale
- Implementation patterns and code examples provided

**Date:** 2025-10-25  
**Status:** ‚úÖ PASSED - READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION  
**Report:** docs/implementation-readiness-report-2025-10-25.md

**Key Findings:**
- All Level 3 artifacts present and complete (PRD, Architecture, Epics, UX Specification)
- No critical gaps or blocking issues
- 2 high-priority concerns addressed during gate check (labor costs, bulk data entry)
- Complete alignment between PRD, Architecture, Epics, and UX

- Architecture Section 2.3: Added Quasar QTable bulk data entry pattern
- Architecture Sections 10.5-10.8: Added complete GraphQL implementation (~700 lines)
- Architecture Section 12: Added i18n architecture (~300 lines)
- Architecture Appendix A: Added TypeScript migration strategy (~350 lines)
- UX Flow 4: Enhanced conflict resolution with field-level merge (~120 lines)

**Total Documentation Added:** ~1,750 lines

**Confidence Level:** High - Project ready to proceed to implementation
