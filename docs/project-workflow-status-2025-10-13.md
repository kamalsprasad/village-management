**Sustainable Model Village Management System**

An open-source web application for managing rural African villages, specifically designed for the Sustainable Model Village project in Katete District, Zambia.

**Key Features:**

- **Modular Architecture:** Admin can enable/disable modules (farm, school, guest, energy)
- **Farm Management:** Track plots, crops, yields, income
- **School Management:** Learner scores, teacher evaluations, attendance
- **Resident Management:** Roles, access control, personnel files
- **Guest Management:** Cabin bookings for paying guests
- **Energy Tracking:** Solar microgrid monitoring
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Village head, deputy, head teacher, teachers, farm managers, workers, learners

**Target Scale:** 50 adults initially, scaling to 1,000 by year 5

   - Output: brainstorming-session-results-2025-10-13.md

2. **research** (Analyst) - Optional

   - Status: Skipped
   - Goal: Research similar village management systems, African rural tech solutions
   - Output: N/A

3. **product-brief** (Analyst)
   - Status: ✅ Completed (2025-10-15)
   - Goal: Strategic product foundation document
   - Output: product-brief-brain-2025-10-15.md

### Phase 2: Planning (Required)

4. **plan-project** (PM)

   - Status: ✅ Completed (2025-10-23)
   - Goal: Create comprehensive PRD + detailed epics
   - Output: PRD.md (Level 3 - 18 FRs, 12 NFRs, 3 user journeys, 10 UX principles) and `docs/epics.md` (5 epics, 51 stories with acceptance criteria)

5. **ux-spec** (PM)
   - Status: Planned
   - Goal: UX/UI specification (user flows, wireframes, components)
   - Output: ux-spec-{date}.md
   - Note: Required for projects with UI components

### Phase 3: Solutioning (Required for Level 3)

6. **solution-architecture** (Architect)

   - Status: Planned

   - Goal: Epic-specific technical specifications
   - Output: tech-spec-{epic-name}-{date}.md

### Phase 4: Implementation (Iterative)

8. **create-story** → **story-ready** → **story-context** → **dev-story** → **story-approved**
   - Status: Planned
   - Goal: Iterative story development cycle
   - Agents: SM + DEV

## Decisions Log

- **2025-10-13**: Created workflow status file. Project identified as Level 3 Complex System (Sustainable Model Village Management). Starting with brainstorm-project workflow to ensure feature completeness.
- **2025-10-13**: Completed comprehensive brainstorming session. Defined all core and optional modules, roles, sample data requirements.
- **2025-10-15**: Completed Product Brief with full technical architecture (Quasar SSR, Appwrite TablesDB, Chart.js). Defined MVP scope, constraints, risks.
- **2025-10-16**: Phase 1 Analysis complete. Moving to Phase 2 Planning - PRD development.
- **2025-10-16**: PRD completed. 18 functional requirements, 12 non-functional requirements, 3 detailed user journeys, 10 UX principles, 5 epics planned.
- **2025-10-23**: plan-project workflow completed. Produced `docs/epics.md` with 5 epics and 51 detailed stories; updated `docs/bmm-workflow-status.md` and project workflow to proceed to implementation.

## What to do next

**Next Action:** Kick off implementation by generating the first story context from Epic 1 (`Story 1.1`) using the create-story workflow.

**Command to run:** `*create-story`

**Agent to load:** DEV (Developer)
