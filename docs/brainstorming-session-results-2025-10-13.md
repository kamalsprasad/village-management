- Cross-cutting concerns (Equipment, Vendors, IoT, Finance)
- Role-based access and permissions
- Phased development approach (big picture ‚Üí granular)
- First-time user experience and onboarding
- Sample data for exploration vs. production setup

## Technique Sessions

### Session 1: Mind Mapping - Village Ecosystem (In Progress)

**Focus:** Systematically mapping all village operations, entities, and relationships to identify gaps and opportunities.

#### Core Modules Defined:

**Core Modules (Always Enabled):**
1. **Residents Management** - Village residents with role-based access, multi-role support
2. **Households Management** - Single family, multi-family, guest houses, dormitories, admin buildings; tracks occupants, room assignments, construction details
3. **Finance Module** - Income tracking, expense tracking, budgeting, village lending to residents, financial reports
4. **Inventory Module** - Farm inputs, school supplies, medical supplies (basic), kitchen supplies; stock levels and reorder alerts
5. **Village Calendar** - Single global calendar with category filters (School, Farm, Village, Guests, Equipment, Energy); filters reset each session
6. **Cloud Storage** - Role-based storage quotas (Admin: unlimited, Village Head: 20GB, Teachers: 5GB, Residents: 2GB, Learners: 1GB); personal and shared storage via Appwrite

**Optional Modules (Enable in Setup):**
7. **Farm Management** - Plots, crops, planting schedules, harvest tracking, yields, income; future: irrigation, task assignments, pest tracking
8. **School Management** - Learners, teachers, test scores, teacher evaluations (peer/self/head teacher), attendance (TO BE EXPLORED IN DETAIL)
9. **Guests Management** - Paying guests, trainees (education, farm, village management, volunteer); booking, housing assignment; guests >3 months trigger weekly alerts to Village Management Team for potential resident conversion
10. **Equipment Management** - Village-wide assets (farm tools, school bus, admin vehicles, solar equipment); procurement tracking, warranty info, maintenance schedules, vendor details
11. **Vendors/Suppliers** - Bidirectional relationships (buy from/sell to); contact info, payment terms, quality ratings, contracts, preferred vendor status, transaction history
12. **Energy Management** - Solar microgrid monitoring, production/consumption tracking, real-time data

**Future/Plugin Modules:**
13. **Water Management** - Borehole monitoring, rainwater catchment, water quality (Post-MVP)
14. **Medical/Clinic** - For organizations running full clinics
15. **Custom Modules** - Plugin architecture for extensibility

#### Key Architectural Decisions:

**1. Modular & Extensible Architecture**
- Plugin/module system for custom extensions
- Standard APIs for module interaction with core
- Module registry concept
- Permission system extends to custom modules
- **Noted for Phase 3 Solution Architecture**

**2. IoT Integration Layer (Cross-Cutting)**
- Flexible integration with various IoT devices (weather stations, soil sensors, solar monitors, water sensors)
- Generic sensor data ingestion (REST API, MQTT, webhooks)
- Device type abstraction
- Configurable data mapping
- Real-time alerts and historical data storage
- Not locked to specific modules

**3. Equipment Module (Cross-Cutting)**
- Centralized tracking across all village operations
- Prevents duplication
- Tracks: procurement date, vendor/dealer, warranty info, maintenance history, condition, location
- Serves Farm, School, Admin, Energy, and future modules

**4. Vendors/Suppliers Module (Cross-Cutting)**
- Tracks both suppliers (inputs) and buyers (outputs)
- Supports formal businesses and individual community members
- Integration with Finance and Equipment modules

**5. Finance Module with Village Lending**
- Single module handles all financial operations
- Village acts as micro-lender to residents
- Tracks: loans, repayment schedules, interest, collateral
- Unified financial reporting (P&L, cash flow, balance sheet, donor reports)

**6. Households as Core Entity**
- Essential for village social structure
- Types: Single Family, Multi-Family, Guest House, Dormitory, Admin Building, Other
- Tracks occupants with relationships
- Room/unit numbers for dormitories
- Links to residents and guests
- Future: Individual utility monitoring per household

**7. Guest vs. Resident Definition**
- **Residents (App Users):** Permanent village residents, outside learners attending village school, long-term volunteers (>3 months)
- **Guests (Data Records Only):** Short-term guests/trainees (‚â§3 months), no app login access
- System alerts Village Management Team when guest stay exceeds 90 days
- Manual conversion process from guest to resident

**8. Unified Guests Module**
- Single module with guest type field (Paying Guest, Education Trainee, Farm Trainee, Village Management Trainee, Volunteer, Researcher, Other)
- Tracks: arrival/departure, duration, housing assignment, payment status, training program, supervisor, progress notes
- Some trainees pay, some don't
- Housed in dormitory-style rooms with shared facilities

**9. Calendar Architecture**
- Single global calendar for all users
- Events tagged by category (School, Farm, Village, Guests, Equipment, Energy, Other)
- Filter UI with checkboxes (filters reset each session)
- Role-based event creation permissions
- Events Coordinator can edit all calendar types

**10. Role-Based Access Control**
- Users can have multiple roles (e.g., Admin + Village Head, Teacher + Farm Manager)
- Permissions are union of all assigned roles
- Calendar visibility based on roles
- Storage quotas based on primary role (adjustable by Admin per user)

#### Development Strategy:

#### **Farm Plots:**

```
farm_plots:
- plot_id (PK)
- plot_name (e.g., "Maize Field A", "Vegetable Garden")
- plot_size_hectares (REQUIRED - used for yield calculations)
- location_description (text)
- soil_type (optional for MVP)
- assigned_crop_manager_id (user_id FK - can be NULL)
- status (active, fallow, retired)
- created_date
- notes
```

**Plot Assignment:**
```
plot_assignments:
- assignment_id (PK)
- plot_id (FK)
- crop_manager_id (user_id FK)
- assigned_by (user_id - Farm Manager)
- assignment_date
- is_active (boolean)
- notes
```

**Business Rule:** One plot can have only ONE active Crop Manager at a time.

---

#### **Planting Records:**

```
plantings:
- planting_id (PK)
- plot_id (FK)
- crop_id (FK)
- planting_date
- expected_first_harvest_date (auto-calculated: planting_date + crop.maturity_days, can be overridden)
- planting_status (planted, growing, harvesting, completed, failed)
- is_perennial (boolean - from crop.crop_type)
- failure_reason (drought, flood, pest, disease, other - only if failed)
- failure_notes (text)
- years_active (for perennials - auto-calculated)
- seeds_used_kg
- seeds_inventory_id (FK - which seed batch was used)
- seeds_cost (auto-calculated: seeds_used_kg √ó inventory.unit_cost)
- planted_by (user_id)
- created_date
- updated_date
- notes
```

**Lifecycle Patterns:**

**Annual Crops:**
- Plant once ‚Üí Harvest once (or over multiple days) ‚Üí Status = completed
- Expected harvest date = planting_date + crop.maturity_days

**Perennial Crops:**
- Plant once ‚Üí Harvest multiple times over years ‚Üí Status stays "harvesting"
- Expected harvest date = NULL or manual entry per harvest cycle
- years_active field tracks longevity

**Crop Failure Tracking:**
- Status = "failed"
- Reason required: drought, flood, pest, disease, other
- Notes field for additional context

---

#### **Harvest Tracking:**

**Core Tracking Unit: PLOTS (not individual harvests)**
- Track what's growing on each plot
- Track when plot was harvested
- Track yield per plot
- Link harvests to original planting records
- Cumulative yield tracking per planting cycle

**Harvest Types:**

**1. Single Day Harvest:**
- Entire plot harvested in one day
- Small plots, quick harvests
- One harvest record, marked complete immediately

**2. Multi-Day Aggregate Harvest:**
- Large plot harvested over multiple days
- Counts as ONE harvest event
- Examples: Large soy field (3 days), maize field (5 days), moringa for commercial sale
- Daily quantities tracked in harvest_details table
- Farm/Crop Manager marks complete when final day done

**3. Continuous Picking Harvest:**
- Ongoing harvests from same planting over weeks/months
- Each picking is a SEPARATE harvest event
- Examples: Tomatoes (weekly for 3 months), vegetables, moringa for local sale
- All harvest events link back to same planting_id
- Cumulative yield calculated via SUM

**Data Structure:**

```
harvests:
- harvest_id (PK)
- planting_id (FK - links back to planting)
- harvest_type (single_day, multi_day_aggregate, continuous_picking)
- harvest_start_date
- harvest_end_date (for multi-day harvests)
- total_quantity_kg (cumulative)
- harvest_status (in_progress, completed)
- is_available_for_sale (boolean - auto-set to true when completed)
- completed_by (user_id)
- completion_date
- created_by (user_id)
- created_date
- updated_date
- notes

harvest_details (for multi-day tracking):
- detail_id (PK)
- harvest_id (FK)
- harvest_date (specific day)
- quantity_kg (that day's harvest)
- recorded_by (user_id)
- recorded_date
- notes
```

**Harvest Completion Permissions:**
- Farm Manager: Can mark ANY harvest as complete
- Crop Manager: Can mark harvests complete for assigned plots only
- Continuous harvests: Each picking marked complete immediately

**Dashboard View: "Harvest Status by Crop Type"**
- Groups all plots by crop type
- Shows harvest status per plot (not started, in progress, completed)
- Visibility rule: Farm Manager sees full picture before deciding to sell
- No system enforcement - just decision-making visibility

---

#### **Inventory Integration (Automatic):**

**When harvest status = "completed":**

**Appwrite Function Trigger:**
```
1. Create inventory_items record
2. Set item_type = 'farm_produce'
3. Set source_module = 'farm'
4. Set source_reference_id = harvest_id
5. Set quantity_current = harvest.total_quantity_kg
6. Set quantity_original = harvest.total_quantity_kg
7. Set estimated_value = calculated (see below)
8. Set status = 'available_for_sale'
9. Set date_added = harvest.completion_date
```

**Estimated Value Calculation (Hybrid Approach):**
- **Auto-calculate:** AVG(previous_sales.price_per_kg for that crop, last 3-6 months) √ó harvest.total_quantity_kg
- **Override:** Farm Manager can manually override if auto-calculation is inaccurate
- **Fallback:** If no historical data exists, Farm Manager enters manually
- **Purpose:** Compare estimated income vs. actual income from sales

**Inventory Structure:**
```
inventory_items:
- inventory_id (PK)
- item_type (farm_produce, farm_input, school_supply, medical_supply, kitchen_supply)
- item_name
- source_module (farm, finance, donation)
- source_reference_id (harvest_id, finance_transaction_id, etc.)
- quantity_current
- quantity_original
- unit (kg, tons, liters, pieces, packets)
- unit_cost (for inputs: cost per unit)
- total_cost (for inputs: total purchase cost)
- estimated_value (for farm_produce: auto-calculated with override)
- estimated_value_override (boolean - true if manually set)
- status (in_stock, available_for_sale, reserved, sold, depleted)
- date_added
- location (optional - warehouse tracking Post-MVP)
- notes
- created_by (user_id)
- created_date
- updated_date
```

**No Data Duplication:**
- Inventory references harvest_id for all crop details
- Fetch via GraphQL: inventory ‚Üí harvest ‚Üí planting ‚Üí crop
- Single source of truth

---

#### **Financial Integration:**

**Income Recording: At Point of Sale (Not at Harvest)**
- Harvest completion creates inventory with estimated value
- Actual income recorded when sale happens
- Enables comparison: estimated vs. actual income

**Sale Workflow:**

**Who Can Initiate Sales:**
- Farm Manager (any crop)
- Crop Manager (their assigned crops only)
- Finance Manager (any crop)
- Admin/Village Head (any crop)

**Where Sales Are Recorded:**
- Finance module (single source of truth for all financial transactions)
- Farm module triggers Finance transaction creation

**Sale Process:**
```
1. Inventory shows "500 kg maize available for sale"
2. Authorized user clicks "Record Sale"
3. Sale form:
   - Select buyer (from Vendors module, or enter name for direct sales)
   - Quantity to sell (max = inventory quantity_current)
   - Price per kg (no fixed pricing - enter at time of sale)
   - Total amount (auto-calculated)
   - Payment method (cash, bank_transfer, mobile_money, credit, other)
   - Payment status (paid, pending, partial)
   - Sale date
   - Invoice number (optional)
   - Notes
4. On save:
   - Inventory quantity decrements
   - Sale record created in Farm module
   - Income transaction created in Finance module (automatic)
   - Vendor transaction history updated (if applicable)
```

**Partial Sales:**
- Track each sale separately
- All sales link back to original harvest_id
- Inventory quantity decrements with each sale
- Each sale creates separate Finance income transaction

**Data Structure:**

```
farm_sales:
- sale_id (PK)
- inventory_id (FK)
- harvest_id (FK - trace back to original harvest)
- buyer_id (FK - from Vendors module, can be NULL)
- buyer_name (text - if not in Vendors)
- quantity_sold_kg
- price_per_kg
- total_amount
- payment_method
- payment_status
- amount_paid
- amount_due
- sale_date
- invoice_number (optional)
- sold_by (user_id)
- created_date
- updated_date
- notes

// Triggers on creation:
1. UPDATE inventory_items SET quantity_current -= quantity_sold_kg
2. INSERT INTO finance_transactions (income)
3. UPDATE vendors transaction history (if buyer_id exists)
```

---

#### **Farm Expenses (MVP Scope):**

**Seeds/Seedlings Purchase Workflow:**

**Step 1: Purchase Seeds**
```
Finance Manager buys 50 kg maize seeds from Katete Agro Supplies for 500 ZMW

Actions:
1. Record in Finance module:
   - transaction_type = "expense"
   - category_id = "Farm Expense"
   - subcategory_id = "Seeds"
   - amount = 500 ZMW
   - vendor_id = Katete Agro Supplies
   - description = "50 kg maize seeds"

2. Add to Inventory module (automatic):
   - item_type = "farm_input"
   - item_name = "Maize Seeds"
   - quantity_current = 50 kg
   - quantity_original = 50 kg
   - unit_cost = 10 ZMW/kg
   - total_cost = 500 ZMW
   - source_module = "finance"
   - source_reference_id = finance_transaction_id
   - status = "in_stock"
```

**Step 2: Use Seeds in Planting**
```
Farm Manager plants maize on Plot A, uses 10 kg seeds

Planting form includes:
- Plot: Maize Field A
- Crop: Maize
- Planting date: 2025-10-15
- Seeds used: 10 kg (select from Inventory)

Actions:
1. Create planting record:
   - seeds_used_kg = 10
   - seeds_inventory_id = [inventory_item_id]
   - seeds_cost = 100 ZMW (auto-calculated: 10 kg √ó 10 ZMW/kg)

2. Update Inventory:
   - quantity_current = 40 kg (50 - 10)
   - If quantity_current = 0, status = "depleted"
```

**Multiple Seed Purchases:**
- Track as separate inventory items (simpler for MVP)
- Farm Manager selects which seed batch to use when planting
- Post-MVP: Auto-FIFO or weighted average costing

**Other Farm Expenses (Post-MVP):**
- Fertilizer, pesticides, equipment maintenance, labor, irrigation, transportation, storage
- All recorded in Finance module with category = "Farm Expense"

#### **Profit Calculations (MVP):**

**Simple Profit Formula:**
```
Plot Profit = Total Sales Revenue - Seed Costs
```

**Per Plot Profit:**
```sql
SELECT 
  p.plot_name,
  c.crop_name,
  pl.planting_date,
  pl.seeds_cost as seed_cost,
  SUM(fs.total_amount) as total_revenue,
  (SUM(fs.total_amount) - pl.seeds_cost) as profit,
  ((SUM(fs.total_amount) - pl.seeds_cost) / pl.seeds_cost * 100) as roi_percentage
FROM plantings pl
JOIN farm_plots p ON pl.plot_id = p.plot_id
JOIN crops c ON pl.crop_id = c.crop_id
LEFT JOIN harvests h ON pl.planting_id = h.planting_id
LEFT JOIN farm_sales fs ON h.harvest_id = fs.harvest_id
WHERE pl.planting_status IN ('completed', 'harvesting')
GROUP BY pl.planting_id
ORDER BY profit DESC
```

**Per Crop Type Profit:**
```sql
SELECT 
  c.crop_name,
  COUNT(DISTINCT pl.planting_id) as total_plantings,
  SUM(pl.seeds_cost) as total_seed_cost,
  SUM(fs.total_amount) as total_revenue,
  (SUM(fs.total_amount) - SUM(pl.seeds_cost)) as total_profit,
  (SUM(fs.total_amount) - SUM(pl.seeds_cost)) / COUNT(DISTINCT pl.planting_id) as avg_profit_per_planting
FROM crops c
JOIN plantings pl ON c.crop_id = pl.crop_id
LEFT JOIN harvests h ON pl.planting_id = h.planting_id
LEFT JOIN farm_sales fs ON h.harvest_id = fs.harvest_id
WHERE pl.planting_status IN ('completed', 'harvesting')
GROUP BY c.crop_id
ORDER BY total_profit DESC
